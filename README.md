# XAML Asset Creator

This UWP app is designed to allow UWP and Xamarin developers to create icon assets from a collection of over 6000 vector icons. The app uses the [SkiaSharp](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/api/skiasharp?view=skiasharp-1.68.1) nuget package to allow some basic editing of selected vector graphics, and then to generate multi-sized (and correctly names) PNG icons files in the selected output directory. The code also uses the [WinUI](https://microsoft.github.io/microsoft-ui-xaml/) library, and the [Windows Community Toolkit](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit)
